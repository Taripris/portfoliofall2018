final project
Challenges with the file path location
media queries could not function

My project is simple and the main focus was having three columns and the middle part is where the user gets into the interaction to explore my about me, see my resume and portfolio. Unfortunately, the main home page I did not animate it. I wanted to create space with some small messages or elements like a dot to be seen by the users that can make users click or click and slide to the right or left in order for them to see and read what is in my work.  

Getting to upload my final project i got a little lost and worried. And i hope my work will be seen clearly.
